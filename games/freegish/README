freegish (free version of Gish)

This is a free version of the game Gish. Gish isn't your average hero.
In fact, he's not your average anything...you see, Gish is a ball of
tar. Gish suddenly finds himself in the subterranean sewers of Dross,
a long forgotten city filled with twisting corridors, evil traps, and
some of the most demented creatures imaginable.

Life isn't easy when you're a 12 pound ball of tar...
