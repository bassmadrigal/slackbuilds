pitivi (video editor)

Pitivi is a Free video editor with a beautiful and intuitive user
interface, a clean codebase and a fantastic community.

It uses the gstreamer media framework, so it has support for most
audio/video formats. It includes hundreds of animated effects,
transitions and filters.

Future versions are not currently possible on 14.2 due to requiring
newer gst libraries than are included on 14.2.

gst-libav is an optional dependency to add libav support to gstreamer

The following optional dependencies are not currently available on SBo:
pycanberra - enable sound notification when rendering completes
GnomeDesktop - file thumbnails provided by GNOME's thumbnailers
notify - enables visual notifications when rendering is complete

NOTE: Please make sure python3-dateutil and python3-six are installed
before building python3-matplotlib!
