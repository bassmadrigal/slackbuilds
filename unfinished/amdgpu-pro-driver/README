This contains relatively untested SlackBuilds for various versions of amdgpu-pro.

The SlackBuilds will take the downloaded Ubuntu package, extract the .deb
packages and repackage them into a single Slackware package. Unfortunately, I
don't have supported hardware yet, so I can't actually test them out. I also
believe that there needs to be some compiling for dkms might need to actually
compiled, but I haven't had time to do dig through everything.
