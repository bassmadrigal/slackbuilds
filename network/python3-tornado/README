Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library,
originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O,
Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it
ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require
a long-lived connection to each user.

This is the python3 version of tornado and it can coexist with SBo's
tornado package.
