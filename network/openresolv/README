management framework for resolv.conf

Allows multiple daemons to manage resolv.conf and configures
local resolvers such as dnsmasq and unbound.

This package may require some manual configuration. Please
read resolvconf(8) and resolvconf.conf(5) for detailed
instructions. 

If using openvpn and the following lines were added to
openvpn client configuration file:

up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf

by passing OPENVPN=yes to the SlackBuild script, it will
copy update-resolv-conf file to /etc/openvpn folder.

Please consult update-resolv-conf before doing this.
