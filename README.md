# slackbuilds

These are slackbuilds that I maintain for Slackware, typically 
the latest stable version unless otherwise specified. The 
unfinished/ folder contains slackbuilds that may or may not work,
but are available if people want to test/fix the SlackBuilds.
Most SlackBuilds are/will be available on http://slackbuilds.org.

If there are newer versions of these programs and you'd like to 
see my SlackBuilds updated, please contact me at the email address
within the SlackBuild or info files (not listing it here to 
hopefully prevent spam).

Enjoy!
