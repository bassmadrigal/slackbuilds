This contains relatively untested SlackBuilds for various versions of amdgpu-pro.

The SlackBuilds will take the downloaded Ubuntu package, extract the .deb
packages and repackage them into a single Slackware package. Unfortunately, I
don't have supported hardware yet, so I can't actually test them out. 16.60
seems to be fully functional with support for multilib (if detected, or manually
forced using MULTILIB=yes). If there are any issues, let me know.
