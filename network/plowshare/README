Plowshare is a command-line downloader/uploader for some of the most popular
file-sharing websites. It presently supports Megaupload, Rapidshare, 2Shared,
4Shared, ZShare, Badongo, Divshare.com, Depositfiles, Mediafire, Netload.in,
Storage.to, Uploaded.to, Uploading.com, Sendspace, Usershare, X7.to and some
others.

Per INSTALL, either rhino or sunspider (the latter is not available on SBo)
are optional runtime dependencies. It is stated they are required for some
sites. However, I have not come across any that didn't work. Let me know
if it should be a required dependency.
