SuperTuxKart is a Free 3D kart racing game; we want to make the game fun
more than we want to make it realistic. You can play with up to 4 friends
on one PC, racing against each other or just try to beat the computer.

Extra karts and tracks can be downloaded from within the game.

NOTE: It requires OpenGL 3.1 support and above to play the game.
