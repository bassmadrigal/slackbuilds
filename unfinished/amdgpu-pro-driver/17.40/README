This requires Xorg 1.19, so it can only be used on -current right now.
If you are using 14.2, please use 17.10 or lower.

This should be fully functional. Please let me know if there's any issues.

The latest kernel I tested module compilation against is the 4.9.x kernel.
It won't compile against the 4.14 kernel. I didn't test any in between.
Patches to enable compiling on 4.14 are welcomed since it's beyond my
knowledge to patch kernel drivers.
