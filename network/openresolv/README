openresolv (management framework for resolv.conf)

Allows multiple daemons to manage resolv.conf and configures local
resolvers such as dnsmasq and unbound.

This package may require some manual configuration. Please read
resolvconf(8) and resolvconf.conf(5) for detailed instructions.

Passing OPENVPN=yes will add the update-resolv-conf script to
/etc/openvpn/. To use the script, make sure the following lines are
added to your openvpn client configuration file.

up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf

Please consult /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf before using the script.
It will likely require editing before use.
